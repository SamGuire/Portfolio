# My portfolio

This project was done using React,TypeScript and styled-component. Recruiters and otential employers are free to explore the website :).

## Setup

if you wish to explore the code base, feel free to download or clone this repo.

### `npm start`

Should run the app in dev mode [http://localhost:3000]. Any modification should automatically refresh the page.

### `npm test`

Should run the tests I have made for the UI components.

### `npm run build`

Should build the app for production. It uses the out of the box bundler offered when you newly create a react app with 'npx create-react-app ...'

## Methodology and Approach

### File structure

I used the basic file structure for most react apps.

- A test folder for running unit-tests for my components
- An asset folder for storing my images.
- A component folder for storgin reusubale components.
- A page folder used to store unique webpages that uses components.

### Testing

I simply unit-test my component to make sure things are well built and work accordingly. However, manual testing is still required.

## Tech stack

This app uses React, TypeScript and CSS (styled-components). I like using TypeScript due to the static typing. Easier to debug. I used styled-components due to being able to add it directly to my component file and reusing styles.
